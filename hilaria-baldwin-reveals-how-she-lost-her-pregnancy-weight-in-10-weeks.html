In a food and fitness diary she shared with <a href=#>Cosmopolitan.com</a> on Thursday, Sept. 3, <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong>’s wife revealed she works out daily and eats clean, but she’s not looking to be thin anymore.</p><p>“I gave birth about 10 weeks ago, but I'm not trying to lose the baby weight,” the mom to daughter <strong>Carmen</strong>, 2, and newborn son, <strong>Rafael</strong>, shared. “I’ve come to a point in my life where I'm not trying to be skinny, I'm just trying to be healthy, and I've found that if I don't really stress about it, the weight kind of just comes off.”</p><p>She does, however, eat a seriously clean diet and makes a point to workout to get her “me time” in.</p><p>Hilaria, who was a dancer growing up and now teaches yoga, always starts her day by chuging a Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water first thing in the morning, despite not liking the taste of coconut water. “I started drinking it religiously when I was pregnant with Carmen to soften the early contractions I had throughout my pregnancy. (My doctor wanted me to drink Gatorade, but I prefer not to drink anything with artificial colors, and coconut water is supposed to hydrate just as well.) I'm totally on the coconut bandwagon right now because I'm breastfeeding my son and it's also supposed to help with milk production,” she shared.</p><p>For breakfast, Hilaria eats with her daughter, and shared that their usual meal is granola with hemp milk. After her morning workouts — which tend to be a barre class at Physique 57 — the yogi will make a smoothie. “I’ve always liked smoothies, but I've started to make a bigger deal about them now that Carmen eats solid foods and is at the age where it's hard to get her to eat vegetables. We share a smoothie with kale or spinach every day. I just make up my own recipe.”</p><p>Lunches typically include a salad with quinoa, cranberries, kale, arugula, pine nuts, and her beloved mustard vinaigrette. “Right now, I'm obsessed with this combination of Dijon mustard, champagne vinegar, honey, shallots, olive oil, salt, and pepper,” she wrote, “but give me Dijon mustard, some kind of vinegar, and olive oil, and I'm happy.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to snacks, she only typically munches on fruits and veggies because she “choked on a chip” when she was a young girl. “To this day, I don't really like chips or crackers or anything like that,” she revealed. “I’m very into textures. I don't like popcorn because it reminds me of packing material.”</p><p>For dinner, the busy mom will cook healthy fats and protein such as salmon.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m weird in that I love vegetables and salad, especially in the summer,” she added in her post. “People tell me I'm so disciplined, but I grew up eating this way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaJ%2BipJGntqJ5wZqjna%2BZo3qzsdWemKWrXZ28uHnSoZxmpJ%2BowW60xKtkqaqVnLuiusKyZLCdmZy1tXnIp2RqaF2ssqa30mZpaWllaIY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-netflix-s-heartstopper-fits-into-alice-oseman-s-book-universe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Netflixs Heartstopper Fits Into Alice Osemans Book Universe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hannah-jeter-bio-age-net-worth-height-married-nationality-body-measurement-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hannah Jeter - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
