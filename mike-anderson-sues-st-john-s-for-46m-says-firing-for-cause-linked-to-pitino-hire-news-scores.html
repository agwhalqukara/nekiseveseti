Keane, cites the hypocrisy of firing Anderson for cause and then hiring Pitino, who was fired by the University of Louisville in 2017 for countless violations, including recruits being provided with escorts at on-campus parties.</p><p>Additionally, Anderson refutes allegations of players not reaching academic standards during his time at St. John's.</p><p>Anderson noted that St. John's won the Big East academic excellence award for the first time ever in 2020. He acknowledged grades dropping following the COVID-19 pandemic but denied that it had a negative impact on the program's Academic Progress Rate (APR).</p><p>Overall, Anderson is suing St. John's for $11.4 million for the money remaining on his deal before his firing, and for $34.2 million in punitive damages.</p><p>St. John's denied Anderson's "wildly inaccurate claims" in a statement:</p>Zach Braziller <span class=acct>@NYPost_Brazille</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Updated St. John's statement on Mike Anderson: "We dispute the wildly inaccurate claims being reported in the media and will vigorously defend those claims in arbitration." &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sjubb?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sjubb&lt;/a></p><p>In four seasons with Anderson at the helm, the Red Storm went 68-56 and failed to reach the NCAA tournament.</p><p>Anderson was previously the head coach at UAB, Missouri and Arkansas for 17 seasons overall, reaching the NCAA tourney on nine occasions.</p><p>Pitino, 70, has won 711 games in 35 seasons at Louisville, Kentucky, Hawaii, Boston University, Providence and Iona.</p><p>He has taken a program to the NCAA tournament's Final Four on seven occasions and won national titles in 1996 and 2013, although the 2013 title was vacated by the NCAA because of the violations at Louisville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2qEdYSMpqCknV2Wu6Wx0aymp2WjqrK0edKtZKOnmKPAbrLOq2Rtbp1iwKLF0madoqqZo7Russ6rZJyZpaiybrjIp6KenF2pvG68yK2gp6ddnbazsQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mon%C3%A9t-x-change-pets-celebrity-pets.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mont X Change Pets - Celebrity Pets</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./la-times-some-fundraisers-crossword-clue-answers-with-5-letters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LA Times Some fundraisers Crossword Clue Answers with 5 letters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
