Not even a few days later, news broke that he was taken back into custody for violating the rules of the house!</p><p>Fans were elated to know that Nida was a free man just in time to be a part of Phaedra Parks‚Äô storyline for her alleged return to Real Housewives of Atlanta. They even went as far to predict that Andy Cohen has been plotting to get his new fiance, Sherien Almufti, a spot on the Bravo series.</p><p>Unfortunately, that excitement turned into confusion when it was reported that the personal trainer was re-arrested for ‚Äòviolating a technical condition of his release.‚Äô He is now listed as an inmate at a Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia.</p><p>Almufti took to social media to defend her man when she wrote a caption alongside a picture of the two of them that read: ‚ÄòThey can‚Äôt stop us babe!!! For those who are confused @apollonida03 didn‚Äôt violate a g****** thing. Another crime against a black man in the system. Jealously is a disease.‚Äô</p><p>She followed her post up with a Father‚Äôs Day-inspired image and added a touching tribute that said: ‚ÄòTo the love of my life‚Ä¶. When I picked you up, the FIRST thing you wanted to do, was call your children. What a beautiful thing to witness, they were sooo happy to hear from you üôåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è Baby, it takes a certain type of man to be the father figure of a child that isn‚Äôt your own. I thank you for being the best daddy&nbsp;#princess&nbsp;ever had. One day they will all be in your arms and you will NEVER let go! üôèüèΩHappy Father‚Äôs Day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp;#freeapollo&nbsp;#prayingforyoualways#continuetobestrong&nbsp;#family.‚Äô</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/Byy5NU_FgB_/</a></p><p>It‚Äôs unknown what exactly Apollo did that landed him back in the slammer merely nine days after his release; however, his rep claims that the father accepts full responsibility.</p><p>The statement from the 40-year-old‚Äôs lawyer obtained by People Magazine read: ‚ÄòOn behalf of my client Apollo, right now he feels remorse. He thought the judge was fair, and accepts his sentence, although he was hoping it would be less. Apollo is elated that this proceeding is past him and is no longer handing over his head. It meant everything to him that his mother and brother spoke on his behalf. He‚Äôs okay, and will get through this.‚Äô</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think Apollo did to violate the terms of his release?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRpbytuM5mpaKckWKvoq%2FKZqCnZZOqwLW7w7JkrKCVp7amuoyao6atlqm2bsPAp6usZZGqwam70aKrop2jYsGwecWrnJ6ZoKS5rbuMa3BsbmhqfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charyt%C3%ADn-goyco-world-music-singer-age-birthday-bio-facts-family-net-worth-height-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charytn Goyco (World Music Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rashmika-mandanna-in-two-piece-workout-gear-is-back-at-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Rashmika Mandanna In Two Piece Workout Gear Is Back At It!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
