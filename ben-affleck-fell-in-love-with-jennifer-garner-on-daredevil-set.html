By then, Garner, 41, had already been once married and divorced to her Alias costar <strong>Scott Foley</strong>. Affleck had just broken off his high-profile engagement to <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>After 2003’s Gigli (in which he starred with J.Lo) and subsequent films (The Paycheck, 2003, and Surviving Christmas, 2004) were ill-received by critics and fans alike, Affleck fell into a murky ditch resulting from the “perfect storm” of flopped films and mass public attention. “I sunk into a morass,” he said of his career. “My wife was definitely around then. Getting to know her, falling in love with her and being connected with her gave me a foundation to reach out and say, Okay, I’m going to do Hollywoodland; I’m going to direct Gone Baby Gone. Those were the steps forward I needed to put positive stuff on the board.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She is by leaps and bounds the most important person to me in that respect,” he added of Garner, with whom he shares three adorable youngsters: <strong>Violet</strong>, 7, <strong><a href=#>Seraphina</a></strong>, 4, and <strong>Samuel</strong>, 21 months. “Over the past 10 years she has allowed me to have a stable home life while accomplishing my professional goals.”</p><p>Despite their <a href=#>wonderful dynamics at home</a>, the Gone Girl star says he and the <a href=#>Dallas Buyers Club actress</a> will not be sharing a screen anytime soon. “My wife and I made Pearl Harbor and Daredevil. With our track record, I don’t know if anyone’s looking for a three-quel,” he joked.</p><p>“By the way, she won most of the fights in the movie,” Affleck said of Daredevil. “Which was a pretty good predictor of what would happen down the road — my wife, holding swords and beating the living sh-t out of me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmepl2Ws6e4xJyiZp6Voblutc1mo6iulWLEqsDHZqGepp6es6a%2BjKCYq6aVp3qwuoydmKudlJrDqriMrJytZZOWua2%2FjKGgrGWnnrOmedOhnGaln6jBbrXMqaarrJGjwW68xKuqqKZdqbxuucRmaWlpY25%2Bcw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brenton-strange-nfl-draft-2023-scouting-report-for-jacksonville-jaguars-te-news-scores-highlig.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brenton Strange NFL Draft 2023: Scouting Report for Jacksonville Jaguars' TE | News, Scores, Highlig</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./na-kel-smith-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Na-Kel Smith Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
