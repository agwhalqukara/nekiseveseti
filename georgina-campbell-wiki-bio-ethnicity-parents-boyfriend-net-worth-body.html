Georgina attended and graduated from Royal Holloway University of London in 2014, with a degree in film studies, and plans to do a masters in the future.</p><p>She started acting in a rather unusual way – she was approached by film director Sarah Walker on the street, who asked her if she was an actress. After saying no, she was told about an audition which she then attended, and got herself her first role.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Georgina’s career started with her lead role of Lucy in the online drama “Freak”, shot in 2009. She had numerous minor roles in TV series after that, until in 2014 she got the role of Ashley Jones in <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Murdered by My Boyfriend”</a>, which brought her to notice; it’s her favorite role because she saw Ashley as a real person with real family and friends. People had big expectations of her in this role and she didn’t disappoint them. She explains how the movie is heartbreaking and life-changing and how it impacted her so much. Her performance won her a BAFTA award.</p><p>After 2014, Georgina appeared again in a number of TV series but only for an episode or two. Some of her noticeable appearances were in the “Tripped” Mini Series in 2015 in which she had a main role, the “Flowers” TV series in which she appeared in six episodes, and eight episodes of “Broadchurch”, in the role of detective Constable Katie Harford.</p><p>Her most important appearance in films was in <a rel=nofollow href=#>“King Arthur: Legend of the Sword”</a> in 2017 – even though it was only a small role, it helped Georgina to be seen, as the movie was a big success, described by her as the most epic film that she has ever done. It was filmed in the same studio as “Harry Potter”, and she met some of her favorite actors – Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. It collected $150 million at the box office, and has an IMDb rating of 6.8/10.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>Georgina has never said openly that Tom Freight, a music maker, is her boyfriend, but she often posts pictures of them together on different occasions, which started rumors that they were dating.

She is 5ft 6ins (1.67m) tall, and weighs around 128lbs (58kg). She has an hourglass-shaped figure, and has a tattoo on her right biceps as well as a pierced septum.</p><p>There are no authoritative sources of Georgina’s net worth, but it is estimated to be more than $1 million. She has an annual income of up to $200,000, depending on the roles she plays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Campbell.jpg><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Georgina is very active on her <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> account – it has 700 posts and is followed by almost 29,000 people. During an interview, Georgina admitted that one thing which she doesn’t like about herself is the fact that she wants attention, and to be liked.</p><h2><span id=Awards>Awards</span></h2><p>She was the first black actress to win the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award for Best Actress for her role in “Murdered by My Boyfriend” shot in 2014.</p><p>Huffington post put Georgina amongst 12 rising stars of 2018.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_favorites>Hobbies and favorites</span></h2><p>Georgina’s hobbies include travelling, watching movies and reading – her favorite travel destination is The Maldives, while her favorite book is <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Metamorphosis”</a> by Franz Kafka. Her favorite actress and the one who motivates her the most is Olivia Colman. Georgina’s favorite food is chocolate, or anything made of chocolate.</p><p>Her favorite movie genre is comedy; she has said in several interviews that she wants to do more comedy movies, but that it’s a very difficult form of acting, and isn’t sure how funny she is.</p><h2><span id=Her_plans_for_the_future>Her plans for the future</span></h2><p>Georgina claims to not have a grand plan for her future – she describes plans as something which can be devastating for you if you don’t make them work out.
