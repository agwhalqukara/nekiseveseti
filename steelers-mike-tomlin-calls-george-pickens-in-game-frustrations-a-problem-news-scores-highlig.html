"We're all frustrated, but we got to manage our frustrations in a professional, mature way and when it's not done that way, it's not necessarily pushing us toward solutions."</p><p>Fellow wideout Diontae Johnson also spoke about Pickens' attitude after the game.</p><p>"He's probably frustrated. My job is just to continue to tell him to keep his head in the game," he <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>. "You never know when your opportunity is going to come and you can't let one bad play define you. So I'm always there for him, trying to keep his head in the game and keep his energy up, at the same time we need him. If your energy is down and the ball comes your way, you may not to be able to make a play. But he'll be fine."</p><p>Pickens, 22, was targeted six times in the loss, recording five catches for 19 yards. The Patriots held the Steelers to just 182 yards through the air, as Mitchell Trubisky—who got the start for the injured Kenny Pickett—threw a touchdown, interception and took two sacks.</p><p>Pickens leads the team in receptions (49) and receiving yards (767) and is tied for first in touchdown catches (three) with Johnson this season. But he hasn't posted a 100-yard game or receiving touchdown since late October, perhaps a reason for his frustrations bubbling to the surface.</p><p>But that angst has become a consistent theme.</p>Jason Cole <span class=acct>@JasonCole62</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Steelers WR George Pickens has some of the worst body language of any player I have ever seen. Even when he catches the ball, he walks back at the pace of a 75-year-old man.</p><p>In early November, running back Najee Harris <a href=# rel=noopener>was seen</a> during a win over the Tennessee Titans talking with Pickens throughout the game and calming him down. The wideout only had two receptions for minus-one yards.</p><p>"I was telling GP, it's OK, there's nothing wrong with being frustrated, it's just how you handle things," Harris told reporters at the time. "Obviously, he's a talented guy. Teams are going to do things to minimize him. But I was just telling him in the middle of the game too that you got to keep your composure."</p><p>Pickens is young and talented, which buys him some leeway, and receivers in general have a reputation for being high maintenance at times. But his demeanor is becoming an issue for a Steelers team (7-6) that is fighting for its postseason life and can't afford distractions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGWEdYCMrKuenZyav7R5zKKinmWkpLqttc1mmpqknKh6qLHOq56eZaCesKyxzaxkoqZdnK6usYyfqa6rpKeutbXOp6pmmV2lv7Cuy56k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-i-am-singer-brickell.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What I Am singer Brickell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-shows-off-2-7-million-house-on-app-has-tyga-s-mugshot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Shows Off $2.7 Million House on App, Has Tyga's Mugshot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
