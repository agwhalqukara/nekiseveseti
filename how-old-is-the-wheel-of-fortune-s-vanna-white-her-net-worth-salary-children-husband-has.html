Though she didn’t make it on stage, she was among the first four contestants. The same year she launched her acting career, appearing in the drama film “Gypsy Angels”, co-starring Richard Roundtree and Tige Andrews. However, in October 1982, Susan Stafford left “Wheel of Fortune”, and Vanna was chosen as one of three substitute co-hosts, alongside Vicky McCarty and Summer Bartholomew, and in &nbsp;the December, she officially became the hostess of “Wheel of Fortune.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence>“Rise to Prominence”</span></h2><p>Thanks to her good looks, Vanna, attracted the public to the already popular show, and has remained in the series until the present day.
