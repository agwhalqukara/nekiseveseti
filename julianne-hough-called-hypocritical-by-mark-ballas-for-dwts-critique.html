It looks like <strong><a href=#>Julianne Hough</a></strong> has picked a fight with childhood friend and Dancing With the Stars dance pro <strong>Mark Ballas</strong>. After performing as a dance pro for five seasons — leaving after Season 8 — Hough made an appearance on the popular competition show as a guest judge on Oct. 7, and her comments on Ballas's foxtrot with singer <strong><a href=#>Christina Milian</a></strong> raised some eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>"There were moments where I felt like choreography-wise, I felt like it was two people dancing side-by-side rather than together," she said on the show. "So I really want to see [Milian] shine. I've danced with Mark. You have to stand in front to make sure you're seen."</p><p>And though the comments were followed by laughter, the room was tense as Ballas could barely muster a stiff smile.</p><p>Us Weekly caught up with the dancer after the show for his reaction to Hough's harsh critique.&nbsp;</p><p>"The one comment for me that was a little funny is that I make it all about me… all the critiques were at me, and not at [Milian]. So I thought that was a little hypocritical comment," he told Us. "I think [Hough] was very insightful tonight though and gave great tips on lines and how to express. We've had a lot of guest judges and I thought out of all of them she was one of the best. So that part, I love. I was the one who kind of got the heat, but you know what, that's OK! It's fine."</p><p>This isn't the first time there have been <a href=#>rumors of a possible feud</a> between the former childhood friends. Hough and Ballas's relationship goes back to the '90s when Julianne and her brother <strong><a href=#>Derek Hough</a></strong> (currently a DWTS dance pro) moved to London to train with Ballas's famous parents (dance champions Shirley and Corky Ballas).&nbsp;</p><p>Hough and Ballas paired up for the Junior Olympics and both won medals for ballroom dancing. But when Hough claimed she was <a href=#>"mentally and physically abused"</a> while training in London, rumors swirled that she was pointing her finger at the Ballas family.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Safe Haven actress never confirmed those rumors.</p><p>Tell Us: Were Hough's comments out of line?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWu6%2BxjKGmrp%2BYYrCiuMuem2agqaW8pL7TopqapF2irrO3jJuYpaSRqHqlrc2coKefXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZaOprrO%2FjJypoqyZpsKmv4xrZ2praGZ9</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-elise-finch-die-elise-finch-passed-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Did Elise Finch Die?Elise Finch Passed Away</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./former-kaizer-chiefs-player-willard-katsande-expands-boss-ya-mboka-clothing-line-with-unisex-range.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former Kaizer Chiefs Player Willard Katsande Expands Boss Ya Mboka Clothing Line With Unisex Range</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
