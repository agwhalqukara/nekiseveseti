According to some fans, the American actress and former fashion model have a tattoo-like scar on her neck.

Online</strong></p><p>While we don’t know why Katherine Heigl had the discs implanted, SELF previously explained that artificial discs like these can be used as replacements for worn-out or injured discs in the spine. These discs, which have a jellylike interior surrounded by a tougher outside, generally serve as padding between the vertebrae.</p><p>However, the discs can rupture or rip, allowing some of the inner jelly to escape. A herniated disc is a painful condition that can occur as a consequence of an injury or from normal wear and tear over time.</p><p>According to the Mayo Clinic, the majority of people with neck pain caused by disc abnormalities do not require surgery. Pain medicines and physical therapy are frequently sufficient to alleviate pain. However, in extreme cases, surgery may be the only option for providing relief.</p><h1 class="h1 profile_headline">Katherine Heigl’s Net Worth!</h1><p><strong>Katherine Heigl</strong> is an Emmy-winning American actress and producer who has an estimated net worth of <strong>$30 million</strong>.
