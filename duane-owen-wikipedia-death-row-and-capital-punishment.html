infamous Florida death row inmate, whose gruesome crimes inflicted lasting trauma on innocent victims.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Duane Owen, a Florida man, was executed on Thursday for the brutal murders of a 14-year-old babysitter and a 38-year-old mother of two in 1984.</p><p>These heinous crimes occurred months apart while children were asleep in the targeted homes.</p><p>After a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, Duane Owen was pronounced dead at 6:14 pm, making him one of the state’s longest-serving death row inmates.</p><p>At the time of the attacks, Owen was 23 years old, and he met his end at the age of 62.</p><p><strong>Also View: </strong><a href=#>Founder Of Hollywood’s Magic Castle, Milt Larsen, Passed Away</a></p><h2>Duane Owen Wikipedia</h2><p>Duane Owen was a long-serving inmate on Florida’s death row, known for committing gruesome murders.</p><p>He was responsible for the rape and stabbing of a 14-year-old babysitter, Karen Slattery, on March 24, 1984, while the children she cared for were asleep.</p><p>Alcoholic parents and an abusive father marked Owen’s troubled upbringing.</p><p>After spending his early years in a Michigan orphanage, he settled in South Florida in 1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

including arrests for burglary, attempted murder, and sexual battery between 1982 and 1984.</p><p>However, it was the 1984 murders of Karen Slattery and another victim, Georgianna Worden, that led to his long imprisonment in the Florida Department of Corrections.</p><p>Owen was executed on June 15, 2023, through lethal injection at Florida State Prison.</p><p>His defense team argued insanity, but his convictions and the severity of his crimes prevailed.</p><p>The case serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of violent crimes and raises complex questions about mental health in the justice system.</p><h2>Duane Owen Death Row And Capital Punishment</h2><p>Duane Owen, a Florida man, was executed through lethal injection at Florida State Prison for the murders of a 14-year-old babysitter and a 38-year-old mother of two in 1984.</p><p>The executions occurred in separate attacks while children were asleep in the targeted homes.</p><p>Owen, who was 23 at the time of the crimes and 62 at the time of execution, had been one of Florida’s longest-serving death row inmates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ap23167002243603-1-jpg.webp><p>He declined to make a final statement before the procedure commenced.</p><p>Owen had been convicted for the rape and fatal stabbing of Karen Slattery and the rape and deadly hammer attack on Georgianna Worden.</p><p>While Owen’s defense argued his mental health conditions and gender dysphoria, the state’s psychiatrists contended that he showed no signs of mental illness and described him as sexually sadistic.</p><p>Owen’s execution marks the 13th in the United States this year, and Florida currently has 314 inmates on death row.</p><h2>Duane Owen Family</h2><p>Duane Owen’s family information is unavailable as of June 2023, but it is assumed they have faced challenges.</p><p>In 1984, Owen committed horrific crimes that forever changed the lives of his victims and their families.</p><p>Karen Slattery, a 14-year-old babysitter, was sexually assaulted and stabbed while two children under her care remained unharmed.</p><p>Georgianna Worden, a 38-year-old mother of two, was brutally bludgeoned to death with a hammer while her children witnessed the incident unharmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RIP-Rest-in-Peace-8-jpg.webp><p>These crimes profoundly impacted the community, resulting in Owen’s conviction and placement on death row.</p><p>The establishment of the Karen Slattery Education Research Center for Child Development at Florida Atlantic University aimed to honor Slattery’s memory.</p><p>Still, it has since permanently closed, possibly due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Duane Owen case serves as a sad reminder of the far-reaching consequences of violent crimes, affecting the victims, their families, and the entire community.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Tina Turner, “The Queen Of Rock ‘N’ Roll,” Passed Away At 83</a></p><p class=postsid
