That said, in the years that have passed since the film came out, the actors were able to move past their issues and even joke about the tension they once had between them.

"The onscreen chemistry between the two of them was terrific, but it was a different story once the camera was turned off," he wrote (<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>via ABC News</a>).

"I did run into him lately, about a year ago at the Guggenheim," Winger said. "He said, 'Do you still say [expletive] things about me?' And I said, 'I never said [expletive] things about you,' which I probably did, but I didn't mean 'em.

She thanked him for "all his kindnesses over the years" and called him a "great human citizen of the world."</p><p>Gere <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>mentioned the award</a> and their reunion in an interview with Film Festival Traveler in 2012. "I hadn't seen her in a long, long time. It was nice to see her there," he said.</p><p>He also complimented her as an actor. "She has a really interesting quality," he said. "It's very hard to be as kind of open and unguarded and nice. You know, a nice person and kind of a genuine person and true heart on camera. That's not an easy thing to do. She's able to pull that off. I could never be that way. I was too complicated. There were too many things going on. Just the straightforward presence is an extremely difficult thing to do."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Julia Roberts Called This Co-Star "Completely Disgusting."</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq6GTna6zsIygnKudXZmyo77AZq6ippeav26yxK6bZqaVrMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./going-through-on-an-itinerary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Going through on an itinerary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-simmons-wiki-age-ethnicity-height-net-worth-girlfriend-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Simmons- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./abba-hit-mamma.html>ABBA hit Mamma ___</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./controversial-viral-video-of-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-shooting-sparks-intense-debate.html>Controversial Viral Video of Cheyenne from Teen Mom Shooting Sparks Intense Debate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./johannesburg-taxi-passenger-s-cat-with-huge-personality-leaves-sa-shook-tiktok-clip-gets-993k-vie.html>Johannesburg Taxi Passengers Cat With Huge Personality Leaves SA Shook, TikTok Clip Gets 993k Vie</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./max-hardcore-age-siblings-website-prison-movies-net-worth.html>Max Hardcore: age, siblings, website, prison, movies, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaSync.
