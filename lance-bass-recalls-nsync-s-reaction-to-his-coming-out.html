"I always knew I was gay. Five years old, I knew I was gay, but I also knew that it was something I'd have to hide the rest of my life because my Southern Baptist upbringing told me that."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I knew, especially in the year 2000, that if anyone found out that I was gay, *NSYNC's career would be completely over, and these guys would hate me for the rest of my life," he recalled thinking.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">But when he finally did come out to his band mates, that isn't what happened.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"The guys are still so pissed that I wasn't able to tell them when we were still a group...they absolutely don't care about me being gay," he said. "The thing that pissed them off the most is they thought that we could've had so much more fun together at the height of *NSYNC. I could've been my real self with them, and they wish they could've had that."</p><p><h2 class="KuBv lFzl GbVC HkWF HfYh kGyA SwCr">Editor’s Picks</h2></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">As for what prompted his coming out in 2006, Bass said he was vacationing in Provincetown, Rhode Island, and a random guy recognized him and asked if he was gay. He said yes, not knowing the guy was a reporter.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">When his phone started ringing off the hook, Bass said he knew he had to say something, so he arranged to tell his story to People magazine. "It all happened within 48 hours of coming back from that vacation," he recalled. "Talk about a Band-Aid being ripped off very publicly."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">Other stars who told their stories to THR include Clay Aiken, Jim Parsons, Rosie O'Donnell and Neil Patrick Harris.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmfK2cqcKzsY6lmKeblWKvor%2FSZqmem5GhubR5zaywp5ujYr%2BmrcKtoKimXZi8rrXNoGasrJ%2BnxoC1w3ZuamhobYB2gQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meek-mill-defends-b-simone-but-opens-up-criticism-to-his-baby-s-mother-milano-who-was-also-accuse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meek Mill Defends B.
